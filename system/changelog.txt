v.0.5.0

if you use the option `sort_order`, update it to `image_sort_order`

- renamed the config option `sort_order` to `image_sort_order`. You need to update your `custom/config.php` and `gallery.txt` files, if you use this option.
- new config option `gallery_sort_order` to sort (sub-)galleries by title, slug, foldername or order-parameter set in the `gallery.txt` of sub-galleries
- inherit `image_sort_order`, `gallery_sort_order`, `download_gallery_enabled` and `download_image_enabled` from parent gallery
- you can now add a `secret` to a gallery, to protect the link; see 'Hidden and Secret Galleries' in the `README.md`


v.0.4.0

when updating to this version, make sure to rename all `collection.txt` to `gallery.txt`

- removed 'collections'; now galleries can have sub-galleries, so no need for the `collection.txt` anymore; if you previously used collections, you can rename all `collection.txt` to `gallery.txt`
- the aspect ratio of thumbnails can now be set via the new config option `thumbnail_aspect_ratio`


v.0.3.1

- new config option `chmod_folder` to control the permissions of folders created by this script (like the `cache` or `content` folder)
- avif is now disabled by default; there is a new config option, `avif_enabled`, to enable avif support. There is still an additional check in the code, if avif is available in the server environment; you need to be at least on PHP 8.1 to use avif
- more spacing below descriptions
- if root `collection.txt` exists, but has no title, fall back to the site title


v.0.3.0

when updating to this version, make sure to delete all files in the `cache/image/` directory, as well as the `.htaccess` file in the root directory and then open the root URL to generate the new, updated `.htaccess` file.

- restructured the image cache to directly load the image instead of routing through PHP
- the `picture` element now uses the `sizes` attribute and a restructured `srcset` attribute for better responsive image loading; previously, we provided 1x, 2x and 3x image sizes for two different viewport breakpoints, now we provide different image sizes and let the browser select the appropriate image size for themselves
- the config option `default_image_size` is now renamed to `default_image_width`
- the default config option `default_image_quality` is now changed to `85` (from `88`)
- added the config option `default_modern_image_quality` to control the quality of webp and avif images
- the avif `source` in the `picture` element does not get included, if the server does not support generating avif files

v.0.1.4

- design tweaks
- bugfix for image navigation in some galleries
- og:url sharing tag is now the URL to the current page, instead of the URL to the root site
- gallery title & description: remove HTML tags that are not allowed; use 'allowed_tags' config option to re-define allowed tags (or set to false to allow all tags)


v.0.1.3

- allow sorting of images by filename, file modification date, exif date or .BridgeSort file (via config.php or gallery.txt; see README.md)
- layout and design tweaks
- enhanced navigation on mobile devices / touchscreens


v.0.1.2

- add gallery name to HTML title tag
- add social sharing tags (Open Graph tags) to HTML head (can be disabled via 'site_sharing_tags' config option)
