v.0.6.5

- removed swipe navigation (has problems with image zoom)
- don't hide elements, if device has a touchscreen
- loading indicator fades in softly, with a delay of 500ms
- bugfix: show loading indicator in lightmode


v.0.6.4

you may want to delete all avif and webp files inside the `cache/image/` folder to regenerate those files with the correct quality

- Bugfix: use image quality argument for avif & webp files
- zip download auto-refresh now works without JavaScript
- darkmode/lightmode toggle
- updated thumbnail hover effect


v.0.6.3

- design update

- the previous image gets now also preloaded
- added favicon


v.0.6.2

- when using a random image sort order, the sort order is now kept for the session, so that image navigation works correctly
- allow setting cache lifetime by type; the obsolete config option `zip_lifetime` is re-added as `zip_cache_lifetime`

v.0.6.1

- added simple footer menu; use config option `footer_menu` to add entries
- refresh lifetime of cached images, so resized images that are still in use do not expire
- system/config.php is now more readable
- small bug fixes & enhancements


v.0.6.0

all cache files will be re-created with this update. old cache files should be cleaned out automatically after 30 days, but you can also manually delete everything in the `cache/` folder when updating to save some space.

- create a placeholder for to-be-cached image files, so we can validate that the specific image is allowed to be generated. this will ensure that only sizes are allowed to be generated, that we explicitly want to create.
- show the PHP execution time as a HTML comment before the closing </body> tag, if debug mode is active
- new config option `webp_enabled` with default value `true`; set to `false` to disable webp support
- the cache now uses the filemtime instead of a filename fragment to determine the cache file age
- the config option `zip_lifetime` was removed (it now uses `cache_lifetime` instead)
- updated cache handling
- small bug fixes & enhancements


v.0.5.4

if you depend on automatically generated slugs, this update may introduce breaking changes (depending on your folder names)

- use folder name as fallback title (instead of slug)
- don't allow file extensions in gallery slugs
- allow `~` in URIs
- change spaces to `_` in URIs (was `-`)
- remove additional `-` before or after `_` from URIs
- remove multiple `-` and `_` from URIs
- when returning to overview, the previously viewed image is now in the upper half of the viewport (instead of at the top)
- when returning from a gallery overview to the parent overview, scroll the previous (sub-)gallery into view


v.0.5.3

- new sort option `random` to sort galleries randomly on every load
- bugfix for inheritance of the download image & gallery options
- code cleanup


v.0.5.2

- when returning to overview, jump to last open image


v.0.5.1

- allow `_` in sanitized URIs
- bugfix for thumbnail inheritance for sub-galleries


v.0.5.0

if you use the option `sort_order`, update it to `image_sort_order`

- renamed the config option `sort_order` to `image_sort_order`. You need to update your `custom/config.php` and `gallery.txt` files, if you use this option.
- new config option `gallery_sort_order` to sort (sub-)galleries by title, slug, foldername or order-parameter set in the `gallery.txt` of sub-galleries
- inherit `image_sort_order`, `gallery_sort_order`, `download_gallery_enabled` and `download_image_enabled` from parent gallery
- you can now add a `secret` to a gallery, to protect the link; see 'Hidden and Secret Galleries' in the `README.md`


v.0.4.0

when updating to this version, make sure to rename all `collection.txt` to `gallery.txt`

- removed 'collections'; now galleries can have sub-galleries, so no need for the `collection.txt` anymore; if you previously used collections, you can rename all `collection.txt` to `gallery.txt`
- the aspect ratio of thumbnails can now be set via the new config option `thumbnail_aspect_ratio`


v.0.3.1

- new config option `chmod_folder` to control the permissions of folders created by this script (like the `cache` or `content` folder)
- avif is now disabled by default; there is a new config option, `avif_enabled`, to enable avif support. There is still an additional check in the code, if avif is available in the server environment; you need to be at least on PHP 8.1 to use avif
- more spacing below descriptions
- if root `collection.txt` exists, but has no title, fall back to the site title


v.0.3.0

when updating to this version, make sure to delete all files in the `cache/image/` directory, as well as the `.htaccess` file in the root directory and then open the root URL to generate the new, updated `.htaccess` file.

- restructured the image cache to directly load the image instead of routing through PHP
- the `picture` element now uses the `sizes` attribute and a restructured `srcset` attribute for better responsive image loading; previously, we provided 1x, 2x and 3x image sizes for two different viewport breakpoints, now we provide different image sizes and let the browser select the appropriate image size for themselves
- the config option `default_image_size` is now renamed to `default_image_width`
- the default config option `default_image_quality` is now changed to `85` (from `88`)
- added the config option `default_modern_image_quality` to control the quality of webp and avif images
- the avif `source` in the `picture` element does not get included, if the server does not support generating avif files

v.0.1.4

- design tweaks
- bugfix for image navigation in some galleries
- og:url sharing tag is now the URL to the current page, instead of the URL to the root site
- gallery title & description: remove HTML tags that are not allowed; use 'allowed_tags' config option to re-define allowed tags (or set to false to allow all tags)


v.0.1.3

- allow sorting of images by filename, file modification date, exif date or .BridgeSort file (via config.php or gallery.txt; see README.md)
- layout and design tweaks
