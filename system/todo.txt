- zip download does not always work; use download=".." attribute on download link, link directly to zip file, use .htaccess for rewrite instead of routing and php.
- hidden galleries with secret link
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links/secrets (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)
	- sanitize secret for URL?
- next/prev navigation via ajax
	- preload next and prev image
- image display
	- avif support
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag
- fullscreen button
- mobile enhancements
- favicon
- maybe theme support?
