- design
- hidden galleries with secret link (hash as link)
	- secret link should be part of the gallery slug, for example 'galler01-hash'?
	- maybe have a 'content/hidden/' folder?
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links
- image download - single files & zip (add config option to disable)
- image display
	- avif support
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag
- caching
	- make sure, that 'cache_disabled = true' works correctly
	- make sure, that '?refresh' works correctly
- favicon
- maybe theme support?
