this list may not be complete.

- Collection() and Gallery() can be merged into one Gallery() class
	- if a gallery has subfolders with more galleries, these are displayed before any images
	- allow sorting of sub-galleries (currently, it's always sorted by slug)
	- make sure, the title breadcrumbs work with sub_galleries
	- make sure, the correct thumbnail gets loaded (see Collection get_thumbnail function)
	- make sure, that the image count in templates/overview.php is correct

- enhance slide navigation
	- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible
- hidden galleries with secret link
	- re-implement secrets (removed with merging of Collection() and Gallery() classes)
	- secret links should be added via /{secret} or ?secret={secret}, and then converted into a session variable and removed from the URL, so only the original link will contain the secret
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links/secrets (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)
	- sanitize secret for URL?
- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag
- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types?
	- maybe add ?pre-cache to a gallery link?
	- stepped, like zip creation
- favicon
- theme support
- add license file
