- collections
	- don't add galleries from subcollections
	- check social tags!
	- Collection() and Gallery() can be merged into one class?
- enhance slide navigation
	- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible
- hidden galleries with secret link
	- secret links should be added via /{secret} or ?secret={secret}, and then converted into a session variable and removed from the URL, so only the original link will contain the secret
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links/secrets (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)
	- sanitize secret for URL?
	- allow secrets for collections
- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag
- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types?
	- maybe add ?pre-cache to a gallery link?
	- stepped, like zip creation
- favicon
- maybe theme support?
- add license file
