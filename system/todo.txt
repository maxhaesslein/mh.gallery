- theme support

- design update
	- enhance slide navigation
		- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible
	- lightmode/darkmode

- favicon

- support for sub-pages (for example an 'about' or 'imprint' page)

- sort option 'random' re-sorts on every request; if we want to keep this option, we need to make sure that it is at least consistent (maybe save the sort order in a session variable, and re-sort every time the gallery overview get's viewed?)

- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag

- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types?
	- maybe add ?pre-cache to a gallery link?
	- stepped, like zip creation

- password protected galleries

- collection.txt, which can combine several galleries by path and can be password protected

- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)

- add license

- 'region of interest' for image cropping

- support for heic/heif as source images
- support for HDR image formats; heic, hdr avif, hdr jpg. maybe needs a bit more time until browser support is there, needs some research

- performance enhancements, so we can possibly use galleries with hundreds or thousands of images
