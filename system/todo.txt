- overview template
- image template
- 404 template
- hidden galleries with secret link (hash as link)
	- maybe have a 'content/hidden/' folder?
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links
	- images need to be protected by the hash as well; the hash should not be in the image url, but should be in a session variable, but the name of this variable should be based on the gallery slug (so we can have multiple galleries open in different tabs at the same time)
- image download - single files & zip (add config option to disable)
- image previews
	- cache resized images
	- convert non-jpg to jpg?
	- srcset
	- additional webp & avif, if available?
	- with blurry background loading image
- favicon
- support for image alt tag
- maybe theme support?
