this list may not be complete.

- sub-galleries should probably inherit the sort_order (and maybe other options, like the secret) from the parent gallery

- enhance slide navigation
	- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible

- hidden galleries with secret link
	- re-implement secrets (removed with merging of Collection() and Gallery() classes)
	- secret links should be added via ?secret={secret}, and then converted into a session variable and removed from the URL, so only the original link will contain the secret
	- if no secret hash exists, create one and save it into the gallery.txt on first access?
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery, and the removal of links/secrets (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)
	- sanitize secret for URL?

- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag

- favicon
- theme support
- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types?
	- maybe add ?pre-cache to a gallery link?
	- stepped, like zip creation

- support for sub-pages (for example an 'about' or 'imprint' page)
- support for heic/heif as source images
- support for HDR image formats; heic, hdr avif, hdr jpg. maybe needs a bit more time until browser support is there, needs some research

- add license file
