- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)

- maybe also use the image filesize or modification date in the cache filename, so we know when an image changed

- re-add mobile slide navigation and enhance keyboard navigation with animations
	- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible
	- at the beginning and end of gallery, wiggle the image to show that there are no more images
	- fadeout and fadein images while loading?

- prev/next arrows: add inverted outline to make them more visible on very bright (or dark) images

- theme support

- zip creation: call zipping function via ajax and update progress/text via js, if js is enabled

- support for sub-pages (for example an 'about' or 'imprint' page)

- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag

- enhance admin area
	- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types - stepped, like zip creation
	- edit gallery name, slug and other information

- collection.txt, which can combine several galleries by path and can be password protected

- 'region of interest' for image cropping

- support for HDR image formats; heic, hdr avif, hdr jpg. maybe needs a bit more time until browser support is there, needs some research
- support for heic/heif as source images; currently we need an external program to convert images to another format, and then read it with PHP. it may take some time, until this is natively supported in PHP
