- enhance slide navigation
	- image needs to move, next image needs to be visible
	- when zooming, we should never, ever load another image

- keyboard navigation: when reaching the end (or on first picture), display feedback that no more images are available (small wiggle animation?)

- theme support

- support for sub-pages (for example an 'about' or 'imprint' page)

- zip creation: call zipping function via ajax and update progress/text via js, if js is enabled

- image display
	- color background (on lazy loading); cache the color either in a .txt file next to the image file (this could also be used for the alt text) or in a cache file
	- support for image alt tag

- function to pre-cache all image sizes and types?
	- maybe add ?pre-cache to a gallery link?
	- stepped, like zip creation

- password protected galleries
- protect galleries with private link / secret hash
	- allow multiple secret hashes per gallery (could be: secret: 12345, 54321, abc)

- collection.txt, which can combine several galleries by path and can be password protected

- 'region of interest' for image cropping

- show some exif information, like camera and less

- support for heic/heif as source images; currently we need an external program to convert images to another format, and then read it with PHP. it may take some time, until this is natively supported in PHP
- support for HDR image formats; heic, hdr avif, hdr jpg. maybe needs a bit more time until browser support is there, needs some research
